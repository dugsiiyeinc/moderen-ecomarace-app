üåü Overview
Shoe Haven is a single-page, responsive e-commerce application built with vanilla JavaScript. It demonstrates modern front-end concepts like asynchronous data fetching (using the RapidAPI service for product data), state management, client-side filtering/sorting, and persistent cart management using local storage.




## ‚ú® Features

- Dynamic Product Display: Loads product data from a remote API and renders it efficiently onto a grid.
- Persistent Shopping Cart: Users can add, increase, and decrease item quantities. Cart contents and total are saved using Local Storage.
- Search & Filter: Instantly filter the product list by name/brand using the search bar.
- Sorting: Sort products by price (low-to-high or high-to-low).
- Modal View: A dedicated modal displays the current cart items, quantities, and total.
